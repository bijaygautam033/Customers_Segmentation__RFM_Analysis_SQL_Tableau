This project is about the overview of the customers' segmentation based on the RFM( Recency, Frequency and Monetary) parameters.)

# About Project

This project is about the sales overview of the customers of 19 countries and the customers' segmentation based on the RFM analysis. RFM refers to Recency, Frequency and Monetary analysis. It is an indexing technique that is used to identify the customers based on the certain groups or ranks and know the loyal customers, potential customers, cutomers at risk and lost customers.

The dataset is in CSV format and cleaned and inspected to generate the insights. I have used **MySQL** to find the insights on various parameters and used **Tableau** to visually show the insights and the recommendations for the business growth.

# Problem Statements

The stakeholders are interested to understand the business growth and business lacks for the particular  toy products and wanted to segment the customers based on the RFM analysis to further grow their business. Below are the points for generating the insights:

* Sales by products.
* Sales by deal sizes of the products.
* Annual sales.
* Sales by the customers.
* sales by country, year and month.
* Top customers, customers at risk, lost customers.
* Sales by status of the products.

* Classic cars product has the higest sales in of $3.92M across all the years(2003, 2004 and 2005). Since the sales for the toy products of trains, planes and ships are low, the company should conduct additional research on the reasons behind the low sales or should do an inspection on the quality of the products.
